            Sit down with a friend and play!<br>
            To begin, input a spotify playlist that the game will take songs from.<br>
            One person, the rater, will rate three songs from the playlist.<br>
            The other person, the guesser, will listen along and get to see the ratings for each song.<br>
            For the fourth song, the rater's rating will be hidden, and the guesser will have to use information from the prior songs to guess the rater's rating.
